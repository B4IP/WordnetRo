Date of completion: 16.05.2015
Author: Daneliuc Mihai, grupa A4
Name of the class/method:	
	Class GoogleTranslate
Description of the test:
		Initially it was verified if the class translates the english word “forehead” correctly. 
	The test passed because it returned the romanian word “frunte”. Then the sentence “I like you” was tested, 
	returning the correct romanian translation “Îmi placi”. So the test for this class has succesfully passed.
Retest: 21.05.2015
	Later, on 21.05.2015 the test passed again after the Romanian diacritics were eliminated, thus “Îmi placi” becoming “Imi placi”.
	
	
Date of completion: 16.05.2015
Author: Daneliuc Mihai, grupa A4
Name of the class/method:
	Class Gsp
Description of the test:
		For this class the english word “pear” was the one given for testing after which a list of all its 
	translations from the Gsp site was associated to this word. The result is supposed to be this exact list. 
	The test failed as it returned an IndexOutOfBoundsException.
Retest: 21.05.2015
	Later, on 21.05.2015 the test passed as it returned the wanted list of translations from the Gsp site and the Romanian diacritics were eliminated as well.
Retest: 28.05.2015
	On 28.05.2015 the test once again passed because a case was made whether the English sentence "I like a book" wouldn't return anything related to the Romanian
	translation "Imi place o carte" and indeed it didn't.

	
Date of completion: 16.05.2015
Author: Daneliuc Mihai, grupa A4
Name of the class/method:
	Class Hallo
Description of the test:
		Similarly to the Gsp class, the same english word “pear” was used for testing and a list of all its 
	official translations from the Hallo site has been associated to it. The test failed as it didn’t return 
	this list, instead it displayed the same english word “pear” that has just been written.
Retest: 19.05.2015 
		The test passed as it returned the said list of translations of the English work "pear" from the Hallo site.
Retest: 21.05.2015
	    Later, on 21.05.2015 the test passed again as it returned the wanted list of translations from the Hallo site and the Romanian diacritics were eliminated as well.
	Retest: 28.05.2015
        On 28.05.2015 the test once again passed because a case was made whether the English sentence "I like a book" wouldn't return anything related to the Romanian
        translation "Imi place o carte" and indeed it didn't.

Name of the class/method:
	Class TranslateAPIFactory
Description of the test:
		Initially it was verified if the class translates the english word “chair” correctly, using a number 
	of engines like Bing, Google Translate, Hallo, Gsp and Word Reference. The right translation of the word 
	in romanian is “scaun”. Another test was made for the phrase “I want a book”, with the correct romanian 
	translation being “Vreau o carte”. Both tests didn’t pass because it returned an IndexOutOfBoundsException. 
	It seems like the Gsp engine failed with the same errors as mentioned on point 2.
Retest: 21.05.2015
    Later, on 21.05.2015 the test passed for the word “chair”, but it seems like the Dictio,Gsp,Word Reference and Hallo sites are unable to return the proper translation for the phrase “I want a book”.
    Like in the previous tests the Romanian diacritics were eliminated.
Retest: 28.05.2015
    On 28.05.2015 a different test was made for each engine. The English sentence "I hope it succeeds" was given for the test. The strategy involved creating a list
containing the possible Romanian translations "Sper sa reuseasca" and "Sper ca reuseste" and then checking whether the translations of each engine would contain
at least one of these 2 options. The test passed because for Google Translate it was verified if at least one of the 2 options presented was the right one and indeed it was.
As for the other engines it was verified whether neither of those 2 solutions was the right one and once again the test passed.

Name of the class/method:
	Class WordReference
Description of the test:
		For this class the english word “pear” was the one given for testing after which a list of all its 
	translations from the Word Reference site was associated to this word. The result is supposed to be this 
	exact list. The test failed because while it did return one right translation, ”păr”, it also returned 
	the genre together with it (“păr s.m.”), which wasn’t supposed to happen.
Retest: 19.05.2015 
		After the test worked for “pear”, another one was made for the English word “orange” and, like “pear”, 
		returned the right list from the Word Reference site.
Retest: 21.05.2015
        Later, on 21.05.2015, after the test worked for “pear”, another one was made for the English word “orange” and, like “pear”, returned the right list from the Word Reference site.
        This time the word ”păr” became “par” as well as other proper translations of “pear” as the Romanian diacritics were eliminated.
Retest: 28.05.2015
        On 28.05.2015 the test once again passed as the English sentence "I like you" returned the correct Romanian translation "imi placi".
