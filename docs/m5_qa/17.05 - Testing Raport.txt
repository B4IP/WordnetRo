	Class GoogleTranslate
Description of the test:
	b.	Initially it was verified if the class translates the english word “forehead” correctly.

	returning the correct romanian translation “Îmi placi”. So the test for this class has succesfully passed.

	Class Gsp

Name of the class/method:
	Class TranslateAPIFactory
Description of the test:
		Initially it was verified if the class translates the english word “chair” correctly, using a number 
	of engines like Bing, Google Translate, Hallo, Gsp and Word Reference. The right translation of the word 
	in romanian is “scaun”. Another test was made for the phrase “I want a book”, with the correct romanian 
	translation being “Vreau o carte”. Both tests didn’t pass because it returned an IndexOutOfBoundsException. 
	It seems like the Gsp engine failed with the same errors as mentioned on point 2.

Description of the test:
		For this class the english word “pear” was the one given for testing after which a list of all its 
	translations from the Word Reference site was associated to this word. The result is supposed to be this

	the genre together with it (“păr s.m.”), which wasn’t supposed to happen.
